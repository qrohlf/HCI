<p>This is an abridged introduction to the three fundamental building blocks that make up every website you see in your web browser. It's designed to give you a basic idea of what goes into creating a webpage from scratch. I've also included some links to more information on each topic, in case something interests you and you want to learn more.</p>

<p>For the purposes of this article, I'm going to completely skip over the mechanics of the Internet/World Wide Web and how a webpage actually gets to your computer. If you're interested in learning more about servers and how the Web itself works, <a href="http://www.jeffknupp.com/blog/2014/03/03/what-is-a-web-framework/">this article</a> is an excellent not-too-technical summary of everything that's going on that I'm not talking about.</p>

<p>Anyways, let's dive right in...</p>

<h1>Anatomy of a webpage</h1>
<p>Almost all modern webpages have three core components that control their content, appearance, and functionality.</p>

<p><strong>HTML</strong>, or HyperText Markup Language, defines the <em>content</em> and <em>structure</em> of a webpage. The sentence that you're reading right now was sent to your browser as part of an HTML document. HTML is the one requirement for a webpage - without content and structure, the Web is meaningless.</p>

<p><strong>CSS</strong>, or Cascading Style Sheets, define the <em>appearance</em> of a webpage. The fonts, colors, and layout of webpages are all controlled via CSS.</p>

<p><strong>JavaScript</strong> defines the <em>functionality</em> of a webpage. Interactive sites like Facebook, Twitter, or Google all use JavaScript to allow their webpages to react to user actions like clicking buttons or entering text.</p>

<p>That's the executive overview. Now, I'll go into a bit more detail.</p>



<h1>HTML</h1>
<p>HTML was developed in the early 1990s by Tim Berners-Lee as a way for scientists to collaborate over the Internet. HTML has undergone significant change over the last two decades, but its core functionality remains the same: it allows people to share content over the Web in a structured and standardized way.</p>

<p>An HTML document is really just a text file that follows a special <em>syntax</em>, or set of grammatical rules. Content is structured using a set of <em>tags</em> that convey information about their contents. Tags are enclosed in angle brackets for identification purposes. For example, surrounding a word with <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> tags would signify that that word is a top-level heading ('h1' stands for 'heading 1').</p>

<p>Much like a set of parentheses, HTML tags come in pairs. Opening tags look like <code>&lt;tag&gt;</code> and closing tags look like <code>&lt;/tag&gt;</code>. So, if I wanted to make a top-level heading in HTML, the syntax would look like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;h1&gt;heading&lt;/h1&gt;</code></pre>

<p>The cool thing about HTML tags is that you can nest them inside each other. This means that HTML documents have a tree-like structure, where elements that are <em>children</em> of other elements acting like the branches of a tree. HTML tags can also have <em>attributes</em> that further add meaning to that tag. For example, the <code>href</code> (hypertext reference) attribute of an <code>a</code> (link) tag controls where that link goes:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;a href='http://google.com'&gt;a link to google&lt;/a&gt;</code></pre>

<p>There are <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element">dozens</a> of HTML tags out there, but the most commonly used are probably <code>a</code> (which defines links), <code>div</code> (which defines sections of content), <code>img</code> (which defines images), and <code>p</code> (which defines a paragraph of text).

<h2>TLDR</h2>
<p><em>HTML</em> defines the content and structure of a webpage using a special set of <em>tags</em> and <em>attributes</em>. To learn more about HTML, check out <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/Introduction">this guide</a></p>



<h1>CSS</h1>
<p>CSS is where things start to get interesting. Raw HTML documents are typically pretty boring looking; most browsers default to black text on a white background. With CSS, web authors can specify how they want their content to be displayed. CSS comes in the form of <em>rules</em> that look like this:</p>

<pre><code>selector {
    property: value;
}</code></pre>

<p>where <code>selector</code> is a reference to the thing you want to add styles to, <code>property</code> is where you specify what you want to change (like font size, color, or width/height), and <code>value</code> is where you specify what you want to change the property to.</p>

<p>For example, everything on this page is inside an element called <code>html</code> and I've assigned it a blue background with the following CSS:</p>
<pre contenteditable='true' spellcheck="false" id="userstyle">html {
    background-color: rgb(225, 242, 255);
}

</pre>

<p>You can see how this works for yourself! Click on the code above and change the <code>value</code> to <code>rgb(125, 242, 255);</code>. This will change the background of the page by removing 100 units of red. Feel free to play around - you can always restore the original background color by refreshing the page.</p>

<p>CSS has <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/CSS/Getting_Started/Selectors">selectors</a> for virtually any combination of HTML tags, and a massive number of <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference">properties</a> that you can style with it.</p>

<h2>TLDR</h2>
<p><em>CSS</em> defines the appearance and layout of a webpage using <em>selectors</em>, <em>properties</em>, and <em>values</em>. To learn more about CSS, check out <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/CSS/Getting_Started/What_is_CSS">this guide</a>.</p>



<h1>JavaScript</h1>
<p>JavaScript (often abbreviated as <em>JS</em>) is a way of adding interactive functionality to webpages. Unlike HTML and CSS, which are markup and style languages, JavaScript is a full-fledged programming language.</p> 

<p>Basically, JS provides a way to run code at the same time that a webpage is being displayed that interacts with the webpage and can react to user actions like clicks and typing. For example, clicking <a id="clickme" href="#">this link</a> will execute the javaScript shown below:</p>

<pre contenteditable='true' spellcheck="false" id="userscript">var count = 0;
document.getElementById('clickme').onclick = function() {
    count++;
    alert('You have clicked the link '+count+' times.');
    return false;
}
</pre>

<p>I've made it so you can edit this code, too! Feel free to play around. If you break the page, you can always reload it to set everything back to normal.</p>

<h2>TLDR</h2>
<p><em>JavaScript</em> lets programmers add interactive functionality to webpages using a full-fledged programming language. To learn more about JavaScript, check out <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/JavaScript_Overview">this guide</a>.</p>

<h1>Putting it all together</h1>
<p>Together, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript provide a rich framework for creating content-filled, interesting, and interactive web pages - like this one! You can actually view the HTML and JavaScript source of this page <a href="https://github.com/qrohlf/HCI/blob/gh-pages/_posts/2014-3-3-html-css-js.html">here</a>, and the CSS that's used to style it <a href="https://github.com/qrohlf/qrohlf.github.io/blob/master/css/main.css">here</a>.</p>

<p>If this post got you interested in doing more with HTML/CSS/JS, <a href="http://codepen.io/pen/">CodePen</a> is an awesome tool that will let you play around with all of these technologies right in your web browser. It's a great way to experiment without having to install anything and with zero consequences if you mess something up.</p>

<p>WYSIWYG editors like Dreamweaver provide a layer of abstraction that's sometimes a convenient alternative to writing HTML and CSS by hand, but the code they output is still HTML, CSS, and JavaScript just like this page. Knowing a little bit about how these technologies work can give you a better understanding of what's going on under the hood when you're writing a webpage, and will let you do things that your WYSIWYG tool may not support.</p>
